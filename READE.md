# Credit Card Detection

During my Data Science internship at InternPedia, I had the opportunity to work on a critical project focused on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using advanced machine learning techniques. This project was a deep dive into the world of anomaly detection and financial security.

**Project Highlights:**

Objective: Develop a machine learning model to accurately detect fraudulent credit card transactions, minimizing false positives and improving security.

Tools & Technologies: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

Key Techniques: Data preprocessing, imbalance handling, feature selection, and model training using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

**What I Learned:**

1. The challenges of working with highly imbalanced datasets and strategies to overcome them, such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
   
2. How to evaluate model performance using metrics like precision, recall, and the F1 score, which are crucial in fraud detection.
   
3. The importance of feature engineering in improving the predictive power of machine learning models.

**Outcome:**

Successfully built a model with a high precision and recall, capable of detecting fraudulent transactions with [Your Performance Metric] accuracy. This project provided valuable insights into the application of machine learning in the financial sector, particularly in enhancing security measures.

**Gratitude:**

Iâ€™m grateful to the InternPedia team for their mentorship and support. This project has not only strengthened my data science skills but also broadened my understanding of the practical applications of machine learning in fraud detection.
